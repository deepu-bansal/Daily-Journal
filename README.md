# Daily-Journal
I have used node js , express js and front-end skills to make this application 

MOTIVE BEHIND
As writing is a very good habit that helps us to unload our mind from many stressful things . So , Daily-journal is a server-side application where you can write your own thoughts and publish it on internet so that anyone can add values to their life from it. 

How to run this in your device:-
1. First fork this repo in your your local repo and then clone it to take it in your remote repo .
2. Open terminal or command prompt or git bash (whatever avalaible) in that folder in which you have cloned all these files. 
3. To run this you must have node , express etc. (can be seen from app.js file ) in your system.
4. Type node app.js. Search localhost:3000 on browser to see this application . If you want to add some blogs then search localhost:3000/compose and enjoy!!
